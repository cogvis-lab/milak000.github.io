Richard Bowden received a BSc in computer science from the University of London in ’93, an MSc with distinction from the University of Leeds in ’95, and a PhD in computer vision from Brunel University in ’99 for which he was awarded the Sullivan Doctoral Thesis Prize for the best UK thesis in computer vision. An award also won by two of his PhD students in 2017 and 2018. He is [Professor of Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/richard-bowden), UK, where he leads the Cognitive Vision Group within the Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing and was awarded a Royal Society Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellowship in 2013. His research centres on the use of computer vision to locate, track, and understand humans. He has been Associate Editor for Image and Vision Computing since 2009 and from 2013-2019 IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. He was a member of the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA) executive committee and a company director for seven years. He is a member of the BMVA, a fellow of the Higher Education Academy, a senior member of the IEEE and a Fellow of the International Association of Pattern Recognition.
