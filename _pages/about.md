Overview
**Few areas of machine learning have moved faster than robotics over the past 20 years – and few will be more important in the future. In our Centre, robotics research has evolved from relatively simple experiments involving a specific task to the development of cognitive systems which can learn, adapt to new environments, and collaborate with each other.**

Our consistent focus has always been building machines that can ‘learn by doing’ rather than being programmed with innate abilities. Over the years, our robotics lab has moved away from industrial robot arms to humanoid robots such as ‘Baxter’ and ‘Pepper’. Using Baxter, researchers are currently working with a major retailer to explore how the online shopping process could be optimised if robots were used in fulfilment centres to pick and bag products.

Our Centre’s robot lab also houses small mobile wheeled robots which are employed in the development of collaborative mapping strategies and the Surrey Autonomous Testbed, currently being used for our autonomous vehicles research. 

Professor of Computer Vision and Machine Learning Richard Bowden explains: “As a lab we have always been interested in deploying computer vision and AI in the context of robotics as it is only when a machine can interact with the world that we have the ability to explore the relationships between perception and action. The things we perceive decide what actions we perform, and actions in the world change our perception. This is key to human learning - so why should it be any different for machines?”

What we work for?
- Reinforcement learning helps robots adapt
- Creating machines that can drive cars
- Localising using semantic vision
- Creating machines that can translate sign language
- Developing learning tools
