### PhD students
I'm always looking for good PhD candidates but normally when I have funding available it is for UK or EU students. This is sometimes due to restrictions on the funding but more often than not more to do with the difference between home and overseas fees. However, if you are an exceptional candidate, then drop me an email. I am happy to work with high caliber candidates to obtain scholarships either internally or from external funders such as the China Scholarship Council or the Commonwealth Scholarship Council.

### Postdoctoral Research Associates
We are always looking for good postdoc candidates to work with us.

- [Research Fellow in Computer Vision and Deep Learning](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DEO878/research-fellow-in-computer-vision-and-deep-learning). Deadline 14th January 2024

#### Internship
Please note that we do not operate an internship scheme so if you're emailing me about this its likely to go unanswered.
