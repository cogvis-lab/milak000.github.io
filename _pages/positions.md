### PhD students
I'm always looking for good PhD candidates but normally when I have funding available it is for UK or EU students. This is sometimes due to restrictions on the funding but more often than not more to do with the difference between home and overseas fees. However, if you are an exceptional candidate, then drop me an email. I am happy to work with high caliber candidates to obtain scholarships either internally or from external funders such as the China Scholarship Council or the Commonwealth Scholarship Council.

Currently looking for high caliber PhD candidates for fully funded studentships.

If you are a first class student and think you might like to specialise in AI and specifically in deep learning, computer vision, differentiable rendering or computational linguistics then this fully funded studentship may be for you.

### Postdoctoral Research Associates
